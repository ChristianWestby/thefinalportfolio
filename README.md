## Introduction
I started working on my portfolio in February 2024. I've redesigned it multiple times to get the perfect look and feel. From the start, I knew I wanted to include audio playback featuring a specific song. I wanted the site to reflect my innovative and funky personality, which is why I decided to name my brand "Slim Funk Design & Development."

Once I settled on the right design, the implementation process went smoothly. I've created two pages to give a more comprehensive and polished impression.

## Features

### Audio Playback
Audio is connected so that when you navigate from the main page (`index.html`) via the portfolio link in the navigation bar, a song starts playing. Please note that the audio might not play on the user's browser if permission for audio playback is not granted in the settings.

**Audio Permissions:**  
I have sought permission from the rights holder to use the audio in my portfolio. As of now, I have not received a response. The audio clip is sourced from YouTube.com. The audio clip is: "Don't You Know - Gramatik."
